# Accident Detection and Alert System   

## Objective  
To detect accidents in real time and send an alert message using a GSM module.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Arduino UNO  
- Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Accelerometer  
- GSM Module  
- Embedded C  

## Approach  
1. Sensors detect sudden impact or tilt.  
2. Arduino processes signals.  
3. GSM module sends an alert message to a predefined number.  

## Outcome  
- Achieved 95% detection accuracy during testing.  
- Provided real-time emergency notification system.  

## My Contribution  
- Interfaced sensors with Arduino.  
- Wrote Arduino program for detection logic.  
- Integrated GSM for SMS alerts.  

## Skills Gained  
- Embedded Systems  
- Arduino Programming  
- Sensor Interfacing  
- Real-time System Design
